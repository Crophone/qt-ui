This is beautiful Chinese student manage system.
It has a beautiful and magical UI with QSS.
(to motivate myself,I say that.)
I know the code is not very neat and is a kind of ugliness.
But I finish it, right?
Anyway,I have take the first step to code, to find a rosy future.



If you just want to see the program in action, you can  download the zip file and execute the "system.exe"  file;
Here is the data to login:
format : ID , password
for student  
'201630661234','123456'
'201630661235','123456'
'201630661236','123456'

for admin 
'xiaobing','123456'
'xiaoshan','123456'
'xiaoyang','123456'


But I donn't know how to add the function of making different user has the same consistent data. That is, how to make the program connect to the Internet and communicate in different clients.After a user change the data, another user will also find the change in his program.
I will continue to learn something new!!!!
